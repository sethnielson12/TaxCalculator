# TaxCalculator

This is my personal tax calculator for the DSU Application Development class. Requires Visual Studio to run. This project is capable of adding new "employees" to the list available and will save their federal and state tax percentages, as well as do all the calculations necessary to determine how much to withhold per paycheck.
